## Introduction
Set of reusable big data real time streaming algorithms. Can be used by  Spark Streaming, Storm 
or any other stream computation framework

## Philosophy
* Plain java API that can ve used from any stream computation framework

## Blogs
The following blogs of mine are good source of details. These are the only source
of detail documentation

## Solution
* Probabilstic frequent count with sketches and count based algorithms
* Sampling
* Windowing
